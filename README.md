## Covid-19 Sentiment Analysis Project 
## Introduction
COVID-19 had a severe impact, affecting public health, policy responses, and the global economy. Yet public sentiment towards COVID-19 and its vaccine varies strongly between countries. Understanding the public sentiment towards the COVID-19 vaccines is crucial for policymakers because it can inform outreach methods and strategies that need to be used to counter vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and public concerns. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant attention to vaccine distribution and acceptance, making it crucial to examine how different regions perceive and react to vaccination efforts. Gaining insight into how people feel about the vaccine can shape our approach to future pandemics, helping to mitigate critics' voices and economic losses by ensuring that policies and communications are better aligned with public sentiment. This can lead to better policy implementation and greater public compliance, safeguarding public health and economic stability.

Research Question: How does public sentiment regarding COVID-19 vaccines differ between the United Arab Emirates and the United States during the delta variant surge in 2021? The hypothesis for this research question is that public sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccines in the United Arab Emirates will be more positive than in the United States, where a greater degree of skepticism is expected. The reason is it’s a tale of two different societies; each country has different societal norms and regimes in place. The United States is known for its diverse demographics, which creates a unique context to analyze sentiments as there are many different cultural backgrounds, political affiliations, and regional differences that can influence public sentiment. On the other hand, the United Arab Emirates represents a different regime type and different societal norms than the United States. Whether you’re an expatriate or not in the United Arab Emirates, when you see that most of the locals are trusting of the government and is getting the vaccine, it will somehow influence your decision. Whereas in the United States, it’s the opposite effect; because you have a large portion of Americans questioning the vaccine, as an expatriate in the United States, many begin to question it too, and we will see how that evolves into the public sentiment in the two YouTube videos that are analyzed. The first video analyzed involves Dr. Anthony Fauci, who was the former chief medical advisor to the president of the United States, taking the Covid-19 Vaccine. The second video analyzed is a video of the United Arab Emirates approving the Sinopharm vaccine, and the video is encouraging citizens and residents to get vaccinated.

## Comparative Policy Analysis: UAE and USA
The United Arab Emirates initially adopted a different approach in early 2020; they implemented a full-blown lockdown. But by mid-2020, they relaxed their lockdown rules and opened up their country to tourists. Tourists from all over the world started coming to live in Dubai as a permanent hub until their countries relaxed their laws. Once the vaccines were approved, the UAE encouraged their population to get vaccinated and required it for entry into the country for tourists. Residents and citizens with the vaccine could avoid quarantine, and those vaccinated who were in contact with a positive case no longer needed to quarantine. Immediately, there was a spike in the number of people taking the vaccine. According to Our World in Data vaccination rates in the UAE exceeded 100% of the population due to the vaccination of non-residents. Meanwhile, in the United States, many people were required to take the vaccine to work. Some states even mandated it for entry into restaurants, and the lockdown was more intense. It became more of a requirement than an option, whereas in the UAE, it was perceived as an option. I believe this difference will play a huge role in skepticism and misinformation, and I expect this to be proven in the sentiment analysis conducted in this project.

Understanding these sentiments is crucial as it shapes our approach to future pandemics. Questions arise: Will intense lockdowns and the requirement of COVID passes for entry into restaurants and businesses deter people from vaccination? Does mandating vaccines in workplaces lead to misinformation and increased skepticism? Alternatively, could a strategy involving relaxed rules without full-blown lockdowns encourage vaccination? The contrasting methods employed by these two countries make this sentiment analysis vital. It enables us to discern, from the tone of the comments, which country garnered more support than the other.

## Methodology: Data Collection and Analysis
This research will employ the APIs of YouTube, capitalizing on the platform's unique advantages for data collection. The primary focus will be on user comments from YouTube videos concerning Covid-19 from December 2020. This period provides a comprehensive snapshot of public sentiment during the spike of the delta variant.To supplement the sentiment analysis and gain deeper insights I will also utilize word cloud visualization to analyze the most frequent words, enabling me to identify dominant themes and sentiments that resonate in the public discourse.
### Section A: Rationale for Selecting YouTube as the Data Source

1. **Broad User Interaction**: YouTube's substantial and diverse user base is ideal for assessing public sentiment. Users from a wide range of demographics engage with the platform's content, offering a panorama of perspectives that are representative of numerous cultural, social, and political backgrounds.

2. **Topic-Centric Commentary**: YouTube comments are often directly connected to the content of the videos, yielding targeted and pertinent textual data for analysis. This direct relationship is particularly advantageous for sentiment analysis when examining responses to the COVID-19 vaccine and related policies.

3. **Accessibility of Data**: The YouTube Data API enhances the systematic collection of comment data, enabling researchers to efficiently compile extensive datasets necessary for a solid analysis of public sentiment. This accessibility is a vital component in gathering the volume of data required for a substantial sentiment analysis.

### Section B: Data Preprocessing Steps for Sentiment Analysis
1. **Exclusion of Long Comments**: In sentiment analysis, brevity is often associated with the clarity of sentiment. Therefore, comments exceeding 100 words have been filtered out, as the analysis aims to focus on concise and more pointed feedback, which can be assessed more reliably. For both YouTube videos, there were long comments unrelated to the video content. For instance, in the UAE video, there were instances of Quranic verses, song lyrics, or lengthy anecdotes about life. Similarly, in the U.S. video, comments ranged from mentions of animals to unrelated song lyrics. A thorough review of the comments on both videos revealed that more than 95% of the comments over 100 words did not pertain to the video content, leading to the decision to exclude them from the research entirely.
2. **Link Removal**: To ensure the integrity of the dataset, comments containing links have been excluded. This precaution ensures that the sentiments analyzed are purely reflective of the comment content and not influenced by any external content that the commenters may link to. Many links led to advertisements or solicitations for payments, while others were links to additional YouTube videos, which could potentially distract from the sentiment analysis.
3. **Specific Word Removal**: During preprocessing, common stopwords such as "and", "it", and "the" have been removed. These words typically do not convey sentiment and can skew the analysis if not addressed. Eliminating these allows the algorithm to concentrate on terms that are more indicative of sentiment.

Initially, the plan included the removal of emojis; however, upon further consideration, emojis are recognized as expressive tools that can significantly contribute to understanding sentiment.
